# Chatbot

## What is Chatbot?
 At the most basic level, a chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person. Chatbots can be as simple as rudimentary programs that answer a simple query with a single-line response, or as sophisticated as digital assistants that learn and evolve to deliver increasing levels of personalization as they gather and process information.

## About the Project
- In this project, the chatbot categorizes which category the user's message belongs to and then returns a random reply from the list of replies.
- Under the tags specified in the intents.json file, there are possible messages and responses to these messages. The intents.json file can be expanded upon request.
